}
```

### ❌ Historical Candles Endpoint (Free Tier Limitation)

**Endpoint**: `/stock/candle?symbol=MIMI&resolution=D`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "error": "You don't have access to this resource."
}
```

❌ **Status**: **NOT available on free tier**

**What this means**:
- Historical price charts (daily, intraday) require **paid tier** ($59/month)
- Free tier only provides **current quote data**
- Your widget's chart and historical data components won't work with Finnhub free tier

---

## ⚠️ Critical Finding: Finnhub Free Tier Limitations

### What Works (Free Tier)
✅ Real-time quotes (current price, change, volume)
✅ Company profiles
✅ 60 API calls per minute
✅ Basic market data

### What Doesn't Work (Free Tier)
❌ **Historical candle data** (daily, weekly, monthly charts)
❌ **Intraday data** (5-min, 15-min, hourly charts)
❌ Technical indicators
❌ Financial statements

### Impact on Your Widget

Your stock widget has **3 components**:
1. **StockQuote** - ✅ Works (uses `/quote` endpoint)
2. **StockChart** - ❌ **Won't work** (needs historical candles)
3. **HistoricalData** - ❌ **Won't work** (needs historical candles)

**Result**: Only 1 out of 3 components will function with Finnhub free tier.

## 🎯 Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Use Alpha Vantage (Keep Current Setup)

**Why it's better for your use case**:
- ✅ **Free tier includes historical data** (daily time series)
- ✅ All 3 widget components work
- ✅ You already have API key: `X7C24AOJS8XXEHXN`
- ✅ 25 calls/day is enough with 1-hour cache

**Your usage calculation**:
- 3 API calls per page load (quote, chart, historical)
- 1-hour cache = data refreshes hourly
- 25 calls/day ÷ 3 calls/load = **~8 unique visitors per day**
- With 1-hour cache, this becomes **8 visitors/hour** = **192 visitors/day**

**Recommended**: Stick with Alpha Vantage for now since:
1. It works with all features
2. Free tier is sufficient with long cache
3. No migration needed

### Option 2: Twelve Data (Best Alternative)

**Free Tier**:
- ✅ **800 API calls/day**
- ✅ **Historical data included** (EOD and intraday)
- ✅ All 3 widget components will work
- ✅ 8 calls/minute rate limit

**Your usage**:
- 800 calls/day ÷ 3 calls/load = **~266 page loads/day**
- With 1-hour cache: effectively **6,400 unique visitors/day**

**Cost to upgrade**:
- Free tier: 800 calls/day
- $9.99/month: 5,000 calls/day
- $29.99/month: 15,000 calls/day

**Recommendation**: If you outgrow Alpha Vantage, migrate to Twelve Data.

### Option 3: Financial Modeling Prep (FMP)

**Free Tier**:
- ✅ **250 API calls/day** (10x better than Alpha Vantage)
- ✅ **Historical data included**
- ✅ All 3 widget components will work

**Your usage**:
- 250 calls/day ÷ 3 calls/load = **~83 page loads/day**
- With 1-hour cache: effectively **2,000 unique visitors/day**

**Cost to upgrade**:
- Free tier: 250 calls/day
- $14.99/month: 10,000 calls/day
- $29.99/month: unlimited

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach (Advanced)

Use **Finnhub for quotes** + **Alpha Vantage for historical data**:
- Quote data from Finnhub (60 calls/min)
- Chart/historical from Alpha Vantage (25 calls/day)
- Best of both worlds

**Complexity**: Medium (requires adapter modification)

## 📊 Final Comparison for Your Needs

| Provider | Free Calls/Day | Historical Data | All Features Work | Best For |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Alpha Vantage** | 25 | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | **Your current setup** |
| **Finnhub** | 86,400 | ❌ No | ❌ No | Real-time quotes only |
| **Twelve Data** | 800 | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | **Best upgrade path** |
| **FMP** | 250 | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Good middle ground |

## 🎯 My Recommendation

### Keep Alpha Vantage for Now

**Reasons**:
1. ✅ **All features work** - chart and historical data included
2. ✅ **25 calls/day is enough** with 1-hour cache (supports ~192 visitors/day)
3. ✅ **Already configured** - no migration needed
4. ✅ **No cost** - free tier sufficient

**When to upgrade**:
- If you exceed 25 API calls/day (>192 visitors/day with cache)
- Migrate to **Twelve Data** ($0 for 800 calls/day, then $9.99/mo)

### Reconfigure to Alpha Vantage

To switch back to Alpha Vantage, update `.env.local`:

```bash
VITE_STOCK_API_PROVIDER=alphavantage
VITE_ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY=X7C24AOJS8XXEHXN
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### Finnhub Free Tier Reality
- ❌ **Misleading marketing** - "60 calls/min" sounds great but lacks essential features

- ❌ **Not suitable for stock widgets** that need charts/history
- ✅ **Good for real-time quotes only** (trading apps, tickers)

### Alpha Vantage Free Tier Reality
- ✅ **More generous features** - includes historical data
- ✅ **Better for widgets** - all components work
- ✅ **Sufficient with caching** - 25 calls/day covers 192 visitors/day
- ❌ **Low call limit** - need to upgrade for high traffic

### Best Path Forward
1. **Start**: Alpha Vantage (free, all features)
2. **Scale**: Twelve Data ($0 for 800/day, then $9.99/mo)
3. **Enterprise**: FMP ($29.99/mo unlimited)
