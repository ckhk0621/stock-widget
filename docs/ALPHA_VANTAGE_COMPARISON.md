### Break-Even Analysis: When Does Premium Pay Off?

**Scenario: Outsourcing API Calls**

If you're paying for API calls on a per-request basis from alternatives:

```
Free Tier:      25 req/day  × 30 days = 750 req/month  → $0
Basic Premium:  Unlimited daily        = ~324,000 req/month → $49.99

Cost per request (Basic):  $49.99 ÷ 324,000 = $0.00015 per request
```

**Premium becomes cost-effective when:**
- You need >25 requests/day consistently
- You value realtime data access
- Application reliability requires guaranteed rate limits
- You need premium support for production apps
