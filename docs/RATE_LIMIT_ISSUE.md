# API Rate Limit Issue - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

## Problem Discovered

Your Alpha Vantage API key **X7C24AOJS8XXEHXN** has exceeded its **25 requests per day** limit.

### Console Evidence
```
[Stock API] Daily data response received: {
  "Information": "We have detected your API key as X7C24AOJS8XXEHXN and our standard API rate limit is 25 requests per day. Please subscribe to any of the premium plans at https://www.alphavantage.co/premium/ to instantly remove all daily rate limits."
}
```

## Root Cause

Alpha Vantage **free tier limits**:
- ‚úÖ **5 API calls per minute**
- ‚ùå **25 API calls per day** ‚Üê **YOU HIT THIS**
- Resets at **midnight UTC** (approx. 8 hours from now)

Each widget load makes **3 API calls**:
1. Quote data (GLOBAL_QUOTE)
2. Chart data (TIME_SERIES_DAILY)
3. Historical data (TIME_SERIES_DAILY)

So **8-9 page loads** exhaust your daily quota.

## Solutions

### ‚úÖ Solution 1: Use Mock Data (IMMEDIATE - Recommended)

Your WordPress code **already has** `useMock: true` configured! The widget will work with demo data.

**Current ../tests/wpcode-snippet.html:**
```html
<script>
  window.stockWidgetConfig = {
    symbol: 'MIMI',
    useMock: true,  // ‚úÖ Already enabled!
    theme: 'light'
  };
</script>
```

**What this does:**
- Shows realistic stock data with random price fluctuations
- Updates every 60 seconds with new mock prices
- **No API calls** = no rate limits
- Perfect for testing and development

**To verify it's working:**
1. Rebuild: `npm run build`
2. Check preview: http://localhost:3008/
3. You should see stock data displayed (using mock prices ~$150)

### ‚è≥ Solution 2: Wait for Rate Limit Reset (FREE)

**Rate limit resets:** Midnight UTC (approximately 8 hours from now)

**Timeline:**
- Current time: ~4:00 PM PST (October 2, 2025)
- Reset time: 5:00 PM PST today
- Your API will work again after reset

**Recommendation:** Keep using mock data until then.

### üí∞ Solution 3: Upgrade Alpha Vantage Plan

**Free tier:** 25 requests/day
**Premium tiers:**
- **$49.99/month**: 75 requests/minute, 360,000/month
- **$149.99/month**: 120 requests/minute, 600,000/month
- **$249.99/month**: 300 requests/minute, 1,200,000/month

### üîÑ Solution 4: Increase Cache TTL (Partial Fix)

**Already implemented:** 1-hour cache TTL as you requested

**Current caching:**
```javascript
const CACHE_DURATION = 3600000; // 1 hour
```

**Impact:**
- Reduces repeat API calls within 1-hour window
- Helps but doesn't solve daily limit issue
- Best combined with mock data or premium plan

---

## Recommended Action

**For immediate functionality:**
1. ‚úÖ Keep `useMock: true` in your WordPress config (already set)
2. ‚úÖ Rebuild widget: `npm run build`
3. ‚úÖ Widget will display with mock data (no API needed)

**For production with real data:**
- Wait for midnight UTC reset (8 hours)
- OR upgrade to Alpha Vantage premium plan

---

## Verification Steps

**Check if mock data is working:**

1. Rebuild widget:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Open http://localhost:3008/

3. **Expected console output:**
   ```
   [Stock API] Using API key: X7C2...EHXN
   [Widget] Using mock data: true
   ```

4. **Expected display:**
   - Stock price around $145-$155 (randomized)
   - Price changes every 60 seconds
   - Chart and historical data displayed
   - No API error messages

**If still seeing errors:**
- Check browser console for config loading
- Verify `window.stockWidgetConfig.useMock === true`
- Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)

---

## Long-Term Recommendation

**For development/testing:**
- Use `useMock: true` ‚úÖ

**For production:**
- Upgrade to Alpha Vantage premium ‚úÖ
- OR find alternative free stock API
- OR implement server-side API proxy with shared cache
